Personal data refers to any data which concerns individuals. It is possible for big data to be open, for personal data to be big and for open data to be personal, but all three terms refer to very different things. Using these terms correctly and understanding when data is open, big or personal is a key challenge to the understanding of the open data field.</p>"
