ODI Fridays: Open research – making harmful habits history,ODI Fridays,Humans Technology Internet Healthcare Facilities & Services (NEC),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgm7KSoBt9Y,"How can open research help overcome the issues currently affecting the research community?

In this talk, Ashley Farley (Program Officer of Knowledge and Research Services and the lead of the Open Access team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) discusses the issues currently plaguing the research community – such as perverse incentives, publish or perish perceptions, and information overload – and how open research practices can provide a salve.

The solution focuses on building from community-led initiatives and imbuing the ecosystem with transparency, ending with a call-to-action to make history by changing the status quo. The time for open access is now and this presentation will explain why.

ODI Fridays: Finding new ways to share digital art,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r4sCYk_AfI,"In this talk, Mateus Domingos will be discussing the Careful Networks project with three of the participating artists: Larisa Blazic, Ailie Rutherford and Shinji Toya.

Careful Networks is a project initiated by Phoenix in partnership with BOM, Furtherfield, The Photographers’ Gallery, QUAD and Vivid Projects.

The temporary P2P network is home to a series of newly commissioned artworks. Each work was initially hosted by another artist. The network exists through a collaborative act of care and stewardship. Visitors are also invited to participate in this. Each of the works has been created within the constraints of a 2mb file size and without external dependencies.

About the speakers
Mateus Domingos is an artist/writer based in Leicester, UK. In parallel with his artistic practice, he is a producer for the digital arts programme at Phoenix, Leicester. Alongside the exhibition programme he works on artist development opportunities and hosts a series of meet-ups exploring digital arts practices. He regularly publishes and facilitates workshops that explore creative coding and various digital technologies. He is interested in text, narrative and the use of new digital spaces. His work has included games, 3d printing, fictional alphabets, maps and filmmaking. He runs a publishing project called Bruise.

Larisa Blazic is a London-based digital artisan, educator and feminist hacker with practice ranging from net.art to Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) art and design. She explores a range of emerging technologies and their impact on online publishing, moving image in public space, collective creativity and participation through work exhibited nationally, internationally and online. The philosophy driving her art practice is founded on FLOSS philosophy and culture aiming to enable a deep, systematic and critical understanding of the technical, social and cultural contexts where creative practice and technology intersect in order to apply these in contemporary art and design.

Ailie Rutherford is a visual artist working at the intersection of community activism and creative practice. Her collaborative artworks bring people together in conversations about our social and economic landscape using print, performance, sci-fi visioning, games and technology as playful means to work through difficult questions and radically re-think our shared futures. Resulting works range from proposed new models for living and working together to the building of new infrastructure.

Shinji Toya is a digital artist from Japan, based in London in the UK for more than a decade. His practice uses creative programming, artificial intelligence, the Internet, participation, video, image manipulation and painting. It deals with the poetic aspects emerging in the tension between what the systems of knowledge and computation aim to capture and what they fail to capture. The recent practice of Toya critically explores the relationship between image, data, and generative processes emerging through networked participation and digital culture(s). This practice often deals with the post-digital data economy and data erasure.",18/12/2021,Video

ODI Fridays: How the BBC builds public service recommenders with data,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C4nKEsI-QQ,"The BBC is one of the world’s leading broadcasters, producing a large amount of content including video, audio and text, spanning topics such as news, sport, education, and entertainment. In order to fulfil its public service remit, the BBC must serve all its audiences, providing each audience member with the most relevant and engaging content for them.

Up to now, manual curation has been the main approach used by the organisation to achieve that. However, that comes with some challenges: it is unable to scale and to be tailored to each user. Datalab has followed an approach based on cross-team collaboration and on the concept of public service AI to address these challenges. In his talk, Alessandro reflects upon this approach and the lessons learnt in the years since the creation of Datalab.

About the speaker
Alessandro Piscopo is a principal data scientist at the BBC, in a team called Datalab. He works on the development and deployment of public service recommendations algorithms across the organisation, to help BBC audiences find the most relevant and engaging content. During his PhD, obtained in 2019 at the University of Southampton, Alessandro studied the effects of socio-technical dynamics on data quality in collaborative knowledge engineering projects.

His current interests include online collaboration, knowledge graphs, and fairness and ethics in AI.",10/12/2021,Video

ODI Fridays: Data and dealing with the building safety crisis,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNznnmUCoaM,"After the Grenfell tragedy the government hoped it would be able to address safety issues in other buildings within a year. Now more than four and a half years on, the cladding crisis has turned into a building safety crisis which now impacts hundreds of thousands of homes across the country.

Martin Boyd and Sebastian O’Kelly from the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership will discuss:

‘Years of systemic failings in building standards are now exposed. People are unable to afford to remediate the homes they thought were safe, People are unable to move homes. People are unable to sell their homes and people are trapped in buildings they are told are potentially unsafe.’

The talk looks at the role that use of data may have played in the buildup to this crisis and how the continuing lack of data limited the solutions the government is able to consider. It also asks if some decisions are being made without any supporting data.

ODI Fridays: Data is not an avocado – why it matters to Gen Z,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJVGZCD0sjk,"The National Data Strategy is part of a conversation about the way data is used in the UK. A new report from defenddigitalme describes why it matters that the words used in that conversation alienate young people.

Jen Persson, Founder of defenddigitalme will discuss why common metaphors don’t work, what it means for the success or failure of delivering a sustainable data policy, and what needs to change.

“Data is the new avocado” might describe the decaying shelf life of records, but not much more. “The new oil” cannot tell a child’s life story. Being framed as “the fuel of artificial intelligence” leaves people feeling used. These metaphors fail to describe the multi-faceted nature of personal data, and do not reflect its incompleteness, accuracy, or the authentic self. The language of commodities doesn’t work on their terms or engender the respect young people want to see for the person the data is about. And while the language on data doesn’t fit with young people’s expectations, it doesn’t fit well with our legal frameworks for data governance either.

“The world in thirty years is going to be unrecognizably datamined and it’s going to be really fun to watch,” said Jose Ferreira, then CEO of the adaptive learning company Knewton, at the White House US Datapalooza in 2012. Nearly ten years on, young people don’t find it fun but they do feel exploited.

defenddigitalme’s new report based on research together with Hattusia and the Warren Youth Project, proposes how to reconcile the focus, governance frameworks, and content of the UK national data strategy, to move the conversation forward in ways that work for the economy and research, and include our future generation.

About the speaker
Founder of defenddigitalme, Jen Persson campaigns for safe, fair, and transparent data in education, in England and beyond. Defenddigitalme has been advocating for the rights of the 23 million people in the National Pupil Database since 2015, most recently through regulatory action, building on the work of many others.

In The State of Data 2020 report defenddigitalme published a mapping of the most common data flows for a child in England’s state education system, from the seven compulsory censuses a year and eight sets of statutory testing, through to some of the most popular local edTech tools used for administration, assessment, behavioural tracking, and for teaching and learning. The report calls for a new approach to digital rights in schools to build a rights’ respecting environment by 2030, and makes recommendations on how to achieve it.

ODI Fridays: Access to the right health data for public good,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okTvCHGPBIs,"Data is the life blood of the healthcare system. It has the enormous potential to address societal and economic health challenges like early the early detection, screening and monitoring of non-communicable diseases, like Parkinson’s.

To maximise the potential of AI in the treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), there’s an urgent need to transform the healthcare system by opening access to data collected during healthcare interventions.

iKure is a primary healthcare provider with focus on addressing the issues of accessibility, availability, affordability and trust when it comes to connecting patients with healthcare services. Use of technology is an integral part of iKure’s business model and operations, and it has a proprietary medical collaboration platform called Wireless Health Incident Monitoring Systems (WHIMS) that presents unprecedented potential in diffusion of clinical, preventive and diagnostic insights. Utilising data analytics and artificial intelligence, iKure’s technology application is attuned for mapping diseases pattern and aligns clinical decision with actions to improve better health outcomes.

Through this discussion, we want to bring attention and interest to the small-scale local health data source can serve as a high value open data repository with enormous potential to address non-communicable disease, like hypertension. While big data can provide dramatic advances in the treatment of NCDs, local data – despite its inherent challenges and limitations – in data collection stands as a potentially rich resource in treatment efficacy and health-based studies.

We will focus on opportunities in data privacy through open data platforms, and challenges that persist in collecting high quality data to find insights of the locally derived relationship between culture, behaviour and clinical information, which may bring shift in care delivery model to better serve the stakeholders in the entire health ecosystem.

ODI Fridays: Does more data make for better politics?,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaITE0tsFSU,"Does more data make for better politics? Are new sources of data, on everything from expenses to voting to Wikipedia changes, altering how we think about politics? What can the monitoring of parliament tell us about what impact, good or bad, this is having on democracy?

We can now monitor the activities of our representatives in ways we couldn’t imagine a few decades ago, seeing at the push of a button how they vote, what they say and what they spend. Our new project looks at whether new platforms and sources, from TheyWorkToYou to IPSA’s expenses map, are changing the behaviour of those being watched and the attitudes of those watching.

Our findings so far show how the new data are being used by a range of people, from activists and journalists to MPs themselves. All these new sources are, at least sometimes, making MPs and Peers more accountable, and subtly impacting upon how they represent us. Data has also helped shaped the expenses expense scandal, proxy voting and reform of the House of Lords.

Together new data makes for a democracy we can shape ourselves and use to question, query, and crowds-source. It can also make those we elect more responsive and more responsible. However, in reporting on voting and expenses, the new data can sometimes reinforce old, unhappy stories we tell each other about politics and politicians.

ODI Fridays: The data will see you now,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GNQ9I58-g8,"Data about people’s health is no longer confined to medical records and clinical trials. It is gathered by wearable technologies and smartphone apps; it is inferred from shopping habits and online behaviour; it is used by insurers and advertisers for purposes besides healthcare or medical research. This is the datafication of health, and it has significant consequences for people and society.

My colleagues and I at the Ada Lovelace Institute have been working to better understand the datafication of health: what it is, how it occurs, and its impacts on individual and social wellbeing. We’ve synthesised existing research and surfaced the societal and ethical challenges that occur when the boundaries of what is or isn’t health data become blurred. We’ve put forward evidence that the datafication of health has created an ‘Internet of Health’, in which everyone is made to perform as a patient, subject to continuous monitoring, diagnosis and prediction.

In this talk, I’ll chart the mechanisms through which datafication occurs and explore how datafication challenges existing practical, legal and conceptual definitions of what counts as ‘health data’.

"ODI Fridays: Life, death and data",ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4rxJIntgks,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be one of the principal factors in how we now organize our daily existence. The pandemic has – rightly – become the focus of much of the planet and in the scramble to manage local outbreaks and protect national economies, new ways of collating information ‘to protect the public’ have been rolled out on masse. The pandemic, and our response to it, has brought to the fore many questions in relation to how and who collects, uses maps and understands data.

However, this is nothing new. While the idea of data driving our lives is newly confronting to many, such technologies – and their failings – have long been used to shape the lives, and deaths, of millions around the world. In the digital age, mapping and data continue to be seen as a fix-all. More people than ever are subjected to having their lives dictated not by elected officials, but by black box algorithms, maps, and data visualisations. As our attempts to hold the pandemic at bay continue, we must look at lessons from other crises and push for a more just world.

In this lunchtime lecture, Doug Specht (University of Westminster) and Monika Halkort (Lebanese American University), draw upon their research and recent publication, Mapping Crisis (2020, University of London Press) to examine the use of data in times of crisis and draw out ethical discussion and chart ways we can work better for the good of humanity.

About the speakers
Doug Specht is a Chartered Geographer (CGeog. FRGS), a Senior Lecturer (SFHEA) and the Director of Teaching and Learning in the School of Media and Communication at the University of Westminster. His research examines how knowledge is constructed and codified through digital and cartographic artefacts, focusing on development issues in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, where he has carried out extensive fieldwork. He speaks and writes on topics of data ethics, development, education and mapping practices, is the editor of Mapping Crisis (2020, University of London Press), and co-editor for forthcoming volumes on Geospatial technology and society (2021, Routledge), and Apocalyptic politics in the Anthropocene (2021, Routledge Environmental Humanities).

Monika Halkort is an assistant professor of digital media and social communication at the Lebanese American University. Her research centres on the intersectional dynamics of digital materiality, race and dehumanisation in contemporary data regimes. Taking irregular migration in the Mediterranean as an example, her most recent work unpacks how conflicting horizons of death are negotiated and modelled in data, opening up new zones of non-being that have been characteristic of modern coloniality.",5/2/2021,Video
ODI Fridays: Data federations – collaborate without sharing,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnzZ57rlyRE,"Data assets have more value when used collaboratively than on their own. For many organisations, however, this kind of collaboration is currently very difficult, whether because the data they handle is private or otherwise sensitive, or they lack the resources and know-how to embark on large-scale cooperative projects.

The concept of ‘data federations’ offers a model which allows multiple parties to commit their digital assets to a shared project whilst retaining control over the extent to which their data is exposed, as well as reducing the need for standardisation. This is achieved through a flexible, purpose-oriented approach to collaboration building combined with the deployment of privacy-preserving technologies such as distributed data mining or federated learning, which allow insights or predictive models to be generated from data without requiring it to be gathered in a central location.

In this talk, writer and researcher Richard Woodall will describe how, by offering an alternative path towards collaboration, a ‘data federation’ opens the benefits to a new range of people, allowing smaller and less digitally mature organisations the chance to develop shared value from their digital assets, cultivate cooperative relationships, and build their capacity for strategic coordination.

ODI Fridays: Tapping the potential of UK museum collections,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTHPMSnh8Fc,"Back in 1888, the curator of the Yorkshire Museum invited his colleagues around the country to discuss how they might work together to compile ‘a compendious index of the contents of all provincial museums and collections …’


More than a century later, that goal remains elusive, despite there being no insurmountable technical barriers and no shortage of well-funded digital initiatives. It’s an increasingly urgent problem as museums struggle to engage their audiences online; respond to growing calls to decolonise; and even stay in business during lockdown and beyond.


Supported by ODI’s Stimulus Fund, a project called Get it together: realising the value of museum collections data is trying to build consensus around a framework for data-sharing that responds to sector needs, dovetails with existing initiatives, and pinpoints what still needs to be done. In this lunchtime talk, Kevin Gosling, Chief Executive of Collections Trust, explores how tapping the resources siloed in the databases of 1,700 UK museums would help this data-rich sector survive and thrive in these difficult times.


About the speaker
Kevin Gosling has been Chief Executive of Collections Trust since 2015. There, he has led digital consultancy projects for clients including DCMS and Luxembourg’s Ministry of Culture, and overseen the compilation of resources on digitising collections and presenting collections online.

ODI Fridays: How data can help us get to a net zero economy,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6rrxADtZ-8,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will be a catalyst for deep decarbonization after 2035, removing carbon from natural gas. Carbon capture involves trapping the carbon dioxide (CO2) at its emission source, transporting it to a storage location (usually deep underground) and isolating it. This means we could potentially grab excess CO2 directly from the heavy industrial emitters such as power plants, creating greener energy.

But there’s a long way to go before the economy is decarbonised, with industry now waiting for the government’s long-delayed energy white paper which will set out the course of action for the UK. Most recently, in the summer of 2020 the UK Prime Minister also stated he wanted the UK to take the lead in carbon capture and storage technology. But what role can data play in this emerging industry?

In this lunchtime lecture , Graham Faiz and Jack Downie from DNV GL will explain how data could play an important part in support of initiation, execution and operation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. They’ll also share the latest outcomes from DNV GL’s activities to explore how third party data institutions could play a part in supporting the validation of data assets associated with the energy transition. And how validating the provenance of that data could help industry build trust in both operational data generated from such facilities and with each other.

ODI Fridays: The BFI on weaponising the filmography,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43m96tYACm0,"The BFI’s creation of a national filmography of feature films – a dataset of all feature-length films identified as British, since the start of cinema, with full cast and crew – raised some questions that could not be answered using traditional research methods.


Questions such as: how many women have directed British feature films? Are career prospects for women in the British film industry improving?


The computational approaches developed by the BFI to achieve the genderisation of 250,000 credited film contributors, not only yielded answers to these questions and more, it also fuelled the creation of a data visualisation platform shortlisted for the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards, and ushered in a new data-driven approach to some of the challenges relating to diversity and inclusion in the film domain.

ODI Fridays: Helping the construction industry to share knowledge,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDRuVnJ4v0,"Dozens of organisations in the construction industry publish thousands of resources each year to help practitioners understand how do their job more productively and safely. Yet in a 2018 survey the Construction Knowledge Task Group found that 38% of practitioners don’t have access to the knowledge they need to do their job, the primary reason given was that they don’t even know what resources are available. The result is a continuously low performing sector, which is slow to innovate and permits major safety failures, such as the tragedy at Grenfell, to happen. This is frustrating for publishers and practitioners alike.

In February this year we set off on a project to improve access to knowledge by creating a standard way of sharing data about what knowledge exists and how to access it. The project has involved the collaboration of over 20 publishers, professional institutions and supply chain partners and will enable new digital tools and services to be created that deliver resources to practitioners where and when they need it.

Tom Bartley, who led the project, will describe the challenges faced across the spectrum of knowledge organisations and provide insight into how the new Discoverable Construction Knowledge standard will help to solve these problems for the improvement of the industry.

ODI Fridays: Unlocking contaminated land data for new housing,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V8U3CA1AlU,"Currently there are over 1.1 million households in England on the social housing waiting list, even though there is enough brownfield land to build an estimated 1 million homes. One of the biggest blockers in developing these sites is unknown ground conditions, making the access to reliable data about the ground incredibly valuable.

Currently, data used during the contaminated land risk assessment undertaken under the Land Contamination: Risk Management guidance are a mixture of open and privately owned data.

Paul, Petra and Darren from Atkins discuss how their project, funded by the Lloyds Register Foundation, has cataloged the datasets routinely utilised in the contaminated land risk assessment and investigated the data gap between open and private datasets. Other barriers to rapid data re-use such as data format have been explored. The aim of the project was the establish a framework for unlocking more private data to help facilitate the development on brownfield sites.

This has made it more important for data to be accessible. However, much of the data that many solutions require are held within private organisations – and are only available if they are shared.

The Data Pitch Data Sharing Toolkit helps organisations that want to generate value by sharing data or facilitating data sharing. It been pulled together from experience collected on several projects and initiatives, including, but not limited to, the Data Pitch innovation programme.

The toolkit explains the concept, challenges, and processes to enable successful data sharing, and provide resources and recommendations to make data sharing successful in practice. The talk will give a flavour of the toolkit and the insights it was developed from, focussing on how data sharing works in practice, which challenges organisations should be prepared for, and how to overcome them.

How it is collected, used and shared can have huge impacts – both direct and indirect – on people’s lives. Data and its (mis)use shape how companies profit, how we consume, even how governments see and serve their populations.

But while some organisations are speaking more about responsible data and ethics, many members of the public still aren’t engaged. They see it as boring, dry or too technical to understand – let alone something they can have any real agency over. This is not their fault, but is often because they have not had enough opportunities to meaningfully engage. This needs to change.

In this lecture, Anna Scott will talk through creative approaches to engaging people in data issues – from illustrated reports to artworks, games to shadow puppets. She’ll talk about the importance of embedding nuance and asking open-ended questions, inviting audiences to actively form their perspectives and seek more agency.

Increasing trust in data: could 'data trusts' help?,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atSgHO1Sxbc,"In 2018, the ODI joined forces with the Office for Artificial Intelligence and Innovate UK to assess data trusts as a potential approach to increasing trust and access to data. This followed the 2017 Independent review of AI for the UK government, which recommended the exploration of data trusts. A data trust is a legal structure that provides independent stewardship of some data for the benefit of a group of organisations or people. We’ve been running three pilots to help understand where they might be useful and to draw some lessons that will help other people understand or build them.

These pilots have been built around real challenges that could be solved with data:

 • Reducing illegal wildlife trade by making wildlife data from across the world more accessible so that new services can be built
 • Tackling food waste by using data to track and measure how much food is wasted in supply chains so that better decisions can be made about how to reduce it
 • Improving city services by exploring whether new services for citizens could be developed through data on areas like energy consumption, parking spaces and charging bays for electric vehicles

We’re pleased to present the findings of these pilots to businesses and governments at the Royal Society of Arts, and to discuss the pros and cons of such an approach through talks and expert panel discussions.",15/4/2019,Video

Discover the risks and learn about the ODI’s plans to help organisations mitigate those risks.
Anonymisation is a set of tools, algorithms and best practices to remove personal information from a dataset while maintaining as much of the data’s utility as possible.
In this lecture, Fionntán O’Donnell, the ODI’s Senior Data Technologist, will talk about how to take your data through the anonymisation process in this important, wide-ranging, yet nuanced, subject.
In the ODI we believe data should be as open as possible. However, we also believe people who handle that data should do so in a responsible manner. Stewards of data must balance the good of opening and sharing data while handling the risk in sensitive data about people being exposed.

ODI Fridays: Routing around malfunction – can the financial system ever be open?,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAav9EW8bdk,"Jimmy Wales (founder of Wikipedia and campaigner for an open knowledge society) once claimed that “The internet interprets any type of centralised planning as a malfunction and routes around it. The command-and-control model is doomed to failure here by the very nature of the network. This is inevitable”. Many of the pioneers of open data, such as Tim Berners-Lee and Richard Stallman, have shared this vision.
Yet the world of finance is still predicated on the command-and-control model. A small number of giant banks control the market in commercial and retail lending, the insurance world is dominated by a handful of large players, who alone have access to the corridors of central banks and regulators.
Dean Buckner, a retired specialist at the Bank of England, explains how the secretive nature of regulation threatens, rather than supports, the stability of the financial system.
About the speaker
Dean Buckner worked at the FSA and then the Prudential Regulation Authority and Bank of England for nearly 20 years, specialising in asset valuation and capital modeling in both the banking and life insurance sector. After he retired from the Bank in January 2018 he set up Eumaeus.org with Kevin Dowd of Durham University, a project to ‘keep an eye on’ regulatory institutions such as the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority and to campaign for regulatory reform, particularly around the need for the financial regulatory system to be more open.",8/2/2019,Video

How do we prevent data being siloed, unintended encoded bias and the dangers of creating a state where the AI market is only shared by a small number of organisations?

ODI’s Head of Tech, Olivier Thereaux, and Project Research Analyst, Lucia Chauvet have been researching a wide range of business models for developing AI systems, to better understand them and to find out the reasons for the current trend in restricting access to data.

At the ODI we believe the ideal path forward will involve increasing the amount of sharing and opening of data for and by businesses operating AI systems, as well as the adoption of a wider variety of business models within the AI community. This will need to be done in a way that secures and safeguards the trust of people while promoting innovation across the sector.

The role of journey data in transport is changing. It is being collected in real time and used on new scales, creating insights into individual and aggregated mobility. Businesses and public services can use this data to make operational and policy decisions to improve transport services, user experience or infrastructure.

The project is part of the ODI’s £6M three-year innovation programme, which has an overall aim to build data infrastructure, improve data literacy, stimulate data innovation and build trust in the use of data.
In this talk ODI Consultant Izy Champion will talk you through the research, give examples of the innovative services created through the innovative use of data, and talk about opportunities to get involved with our project for 2018-19 looking at Service design learning materials

Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Bad data (and how to fix it),ODI Fridays,"open data,data,vizualization,data vizualization",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0unaaHzQb0,"Bad data is everywhere. A CSV that doesn’t load, a spreadsheet that is badly formatted, a date column that has different formats, and so on. A lot of time is spent fixing these issues, instead of actually analysing the data. In this talk, you’ll hear about Good Tables, a tabular data validator that is able to check for issues like:
All rows have the same number of columns
There are no duplicate rows
The data types are correct (e.g. a numeric column has only numbers, a date column has only dates in a specific format, etc.)
It also allows writing custom checks using Python.
Goodtables is useful both if you are a data publisher, by helping you to increase your data quality and facilitate the data reusability, and if you are a data user, by giving you a quick way to check the data for errors. It can be executed locally or via https://goodtables.io, a continuous tabular data validation service.
You’ll also understand about how the Frictionless Data’s Data Package and Table Schema specifications can help you describe and load datasets.

""My colleague had masterminded a successful bid for a European Project, Opticities, and then abruptly left the organisation. My task was to open up real-time transport datasets in a matter of months, with very little budget and no background in open data.

""What followed did not follow a traditional route – the only goal was to get the data from our internal systems onto the internet as quickly as possible. Once that was done, I entered a world completely unfamiliar to the average local authority transport planner – working in partnership with SME’s, Universities, the ODI etc.

Friday lunchtime lecture: Can't find the right code? Explain yourself!,ODI Fridays,"syntax,semantics,data,open data,ODI,Python,Scheme,data set",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCNRiB5jT4,"Data standards almost always have two fundamental components: syntax and semantics.

The syntax is established by a schema, which specifies how the data should be structured. Should it be saved as XML, JSON, CSV? Should dates be written YYYY-MM-DD? What order should the columns be in? These types of questions are essential and catered for in most well-established data standards.

Semantics are more abstract. Questions arise, like: what does this data tell me about the world? What does this number mean? What is the purpose of that transaction? Answering these is more variable and often less formal than the syntax. The most common and trusted technique is to create a codelist – a dictionary of terms which establishes the semantics for a given data point. They can be simple sets of terms – detailing transaction types which can be published in a standard – all the way to rich hierarchical taxonomies. They all associate a code with a meaning, to allow people to communicate with them.

This talk explores the changing role of codelists in a time when textual data analysis is advancing rapidly. The root question is this: is it still best to start giving meaning to your data by looking for a codelist and a code, or can we use description text itself, trusting modern data analysis to do the heavy lifting?

First, we'll consider and contextualise the use of codelists within standards like Open Contracting, IATI, and 360Giving. Then we'll look at how meaning can be established in text where no standard exists – online reviews for restaurants, for example – by applying machine learning (live demo alert!). Finally, we'll apply the same approach to description text found in established open data standards and compare our results.

Less popular is the rate the prices are increasing. The UK average house price has increased 30% since the 2008 crash, and London house prices have gone up 75%, according to the Land Registry House price index from September 2008 to September 2017. In London, price increases are often blamed on empty homes bought as investments by rich foreigners. Areas such as Cornwall and the Lake District blame price increases on holiday homes bought by rich Londoners. However, there is very little data supporting or against these beliefs.

Jonathan Bourne spent a year sending Freedom of Information requests to gather a dataset from over 100 local authorities. He was interested in data on 'low use properties', which are domestic properties that contain no full-time resident. The data covers 22 million people and 330,000 low-use properties. The data shows a clear relationship between price and low-use properties.

In this talk, Jonathan will discuss his findings, showing how London is affected in the same way as the rest of the country and that building more houses may not help solve the problem of high prices.

In the first half of 2014 they worked with the government to allow them to agree a new ""official"" estimate of 4.1 million privately owned leasehold homes in England as at 2012/13.

The data in this sector has been so poor in the past that fundamental misconceptions have been allowed to develop. The government believed leasehold was somehow a lower cost form of tenure. They thought that almost 50% of properties were overseen by regulated professional property managers.

We now know that leasehold construction has grown to become almost 50% of all new housing stock.

Martin and Sebastian, Trustees of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, explain how the unreliable data came about and how this has meant until recently many of our housing policies have been predicated on entirely false assumptions.

The journey to uncovering much of the detailed leasehold data is ongoing and will need the support of the Land Registry and others.

Friday lunchtime lecture: Brexit and open government: 11 months of May,ODI Fridays,"Theresa May,open data,open data institute,lecture,friday,lunchtime,lunch,london,ODI,brexit,government,transparency,Birkbeck,Prime Minister,EU,secrecy,accountability,Freedom of Information,FOI",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4JIqgunGYQ,"How has Brexit influenced the UK’s transparency regime and how, in turn, will openness will shape Brexit? There are three ways of looking at Brexit and open government: 1) possible changes to old policies and new ones being pushed, 2) the new Prime Minister either championing transparency or supporting secrecy, and 3) the openness of the Brexit process itself, which has so far struggled between the executive’s secretive prerogative powers and the legislature’s rights to know.

May’s government will be seen as one that prized secrecy but conceded openness, an object (and abject) lesson in how hard it is to keep government closed in the 21st century. The May administration 2016–2017 is likely to be remembered as a secretive one, headed by a Prime Minister that wished to govern through confidentiality and closed networks. There were some high-profile openness policies, but they were inherited and slow.

In this lecture, Ben Worthy will explain how Brexit shows how badly the approach misfired. The government’s plan of no ‘running commentary’ and secrecy was undermined by the Supreme Court, the UK Parliament and the EU Commission – who all forced greater transparency and greatly limited May’s room for manoeuvre and concealment. The three institutions – creating and using ‘institution friction’ to open up government – also exposed the government’s lack of preparation and undermined the UK’s credibility and leverage even before Brexit began.

The OpenGovIntelligence project is a three year EU funded research project involving twelve partners from seven countries. It aims to demonstrate how better use of data and ‘co-creation’ of public services leads to benefits for citizens and businesses. The project involves 6 pilots, each with two partners: a technical partner tasked with developing software tools and preparing and publishing the appropriate open data, and a public sector partner with understanding of public service challenges, who will test out the new approaches in a practical setting.

Do they ever quantify that change? To a certain extent yes, and their propensity to do so has been growing in recent years, as the movement to assess impact has been taking hold.

Until now some people have been looking at and analysing certain pockets of that data, but nobody has taken impact data for the whole sector and put it in one structured place. In this talk, CEO and Co-founder of SoGive, Sanjay Joshi, will talk about the challenges of creating a suitable data structure for something that is intrinsically hard to quantify, how to create a social enterprise and a business from a dataset, and how this data could help individual charity donors make more of an impact.

About the speaker
Sanjay Joshi is CEO and Co-Founder of SoGive, a tool that enables charities to measure their impact on the world. He has been active in the charity sector for the last 15 years, having been on the board of around half a dozen charities, provided consultancy services for a few weeks at a time for around half a dozen charities across the globe, and has been involved in around half a dozen groups to encourage philanthropy.

Genetic heart conditions, for example, affect around 1% of all newborns, and in around 10 times as many cases they may lead to miscarriage. If we want to prevent or treat birth defects, it’s vital that we understand how different gene mutations affect embryos as they develop.

The DMDD (Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders) programme is tacking this issue by studying the effects of 240 different gene mutations in mouse embryos. In the spirit of open data, the project has made all its data freely available, to encourage collaboration and, ultimately, lead to better understanding of genetic disease.

About the speaker
Dr Tim Mohun is a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in central London. His research group studies the genetic controls that regulate embryo development, focussing on how the heart is formed. Much of his work uses animal models such as the mouse.

Its vision is that UK grantmaking is more informed, effective and strategic.

360Giving supports organisations to publish their grants data in an open, standardised way and helps people to understand and use the data in order to support decision-making and learning across the charitable giving sector. They’ve developed an open data standard as part of their work – the 360Giving Standard – and already some of the largest UK grantmakers are using it to share information about thousands of grants worth billions of pounds.

360Giving is also supporting the development of tools and platforms that allow easy access and use of the data, including Beehive Giving and GrantNav. As the dataset grows, they’re starting to test its usefulness via a series of data use pilots, starting in Manchester.

Over the years, they have evolved from straight-up inventory management to online publications with digitised images for all to see.

In early 2017 the Science Museum Group relaunched its online collection of digitised objects, under a Creative Commons licence via a public API. The museum hopes that the open data will be used in many ways. Researchers might use it to explore the collection using computation analysis, software programmers might use it to explore new interfaces and discovery tools for the collection, and creatives might use the data and images in their work.

This lecture will present the outcomes from a hack day held in February to bring together technologists, designers and creatives to experiment with how this open data could be used. The hack day was run as part of the museum’s Digital Lab initiative, supported by Samsung.

Such graphs are used to make algorithmic predictions and optimisations about our future activities. Only those who can aggregate and hedge raw data emerge as the new power players. This situation creates a new imbalance of power, which can be understood with the concept of data asymmetry.

People’s rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership are important to keep in mind while collecting, analysing, storing, presenting and reusing data.

With that in mind, why is responsible data important for the open data movement? How can the principles and practice of responsible data be incorporated into open data initiatives?

Alix Dunn will talk about the foundations of the responsible data community, where it is headed and how responsible data tactics can inform considerations about what data is made available. She will take a look at how those decisions are made, and how intermediary organisations can help by building responsible data into their strategies. Alix will also look at different sectors that are struggling to understand the potential unintended harm that opening some data can have.

"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Why joined-up data is a political, not technical, challenge",ODI Fridays,"Open data,lecture,technology,government,politics,lunch,open data institute,UK,London",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejjRsGE1WDU,"More data is being produced than ever before, and more and more of it is becoming openly available. Open data has great potential to help drive poverty eradication and improve global development outcomes. Data usage, however, remains relatively low. In the UK, for instance, a third of the datasets found on the government’s online portal have never been used.

One reason for this is because it is hard to join-up data relating to funding, people and outcomes since it is published in different formats, and to different standards. This means that potential users of the data can’t easily see how various bits of data relate to each other.

The Joined-Up Data Standards project has been exploring how data standards can be joined-up, using linked data and semantic mapping. While it is technically possible to join-up data standards in this way, political will and cooperation are key to making it happen.

In this lecture, Tom Orrell will explain the work of the Joined-Up Data Standards project and outline political solutions at the international level for more interoperability between data standards, with the ultimate aim of improving decision-making and accountability.

About the speaker

Tom Orrell is Publish What You Fund’s Senior Advocacy Advisor for the Joined-Up Data Standards project, run jointly by Publish What You Fund and Development Initiatives. Tom’s role is to highlight the value that joining up data standards can deliver for standard setters, data producers and users alike. Tom’s experience lies in the development and humanitarian, digital and data policy, and human rights sectors.

Since 2011, when the first Collide residency awards were announced at the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, there had not only been engineered collisions between protons at CERN, but also orchestrated collisions between artists and scientists.

So what does a curator add to a highly scientific and technological environment? Why are they necessary to make creative collisions happen and matter? These and many more questions will be answered in this Friday lunchtime lecture by Ariane Koek, founder of Arts@CERN, who initiated, created and designed this extensive multi-stranded international arts programme.

In 2008/9 Ariane Koek was awarded the Clore Fellowship and, as part of the award, initiated an ongoing attachment to CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory based outside Geneva in Switzerland. Subsequently she became the first cultural specialist appointed by CERN in 2010 and created, designed and directed for nearly five years at the Arts@CERN international programme.

Koek is a Clore Fellow, independent international cultural strategy and policy consultant, producer, curator and writer. She is an external policy advisor to two directorates at the European Commission on arts, science and technology and also special advisor to Baltan Laboratories, Eindhoven, a multidisciplinary laboratory for artists working with technology.

Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Richard Leeming on opening the cultural archives,ODI Fridays,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pfo_sw_EQ0,"The cultural sector is one of the UK’s strongest assets. It encompasses world-leading broadcasters and some of the best museums and art galleries globally; their collections contain objects that are as important as anything in any other collection in the world.

Most institutions are looking hard at how they open up access to these collections, but in an environment where nearly every public sector institution is facing substantial funding challenges are they getting enough support? Richard Leeming talks about the work of the Research and Education Space and suggests that open data could transform the galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) sector.

Find out from Paul Rissen, Senior Data Architect at the BBC, with a deep dive into the structure of narrative and how data could unlock a new approach to creative expression. We’ll cover the BBC’s experiments in structured data for storytelling in drama and news, why we need the Internet of Fictional Things, and the alchemic secrets of the Web’s pioneers.

Paul Rissen is a Project Manager of the RES project at the BBC, currently helping open the data held by the UK’s cultural institutions for use in education, via the RES Project (res.space). He pioneered the ‘storyline’ architecture that creates structured data from traditional narratives, allowing audiences and machines alike to explore networks of narrative using RESTful Web architecture. He developed this first in fictional environments – continuing dramas at the BBC including Doctor Who and Eastenders – and adapted it to news, where it has been the basis for new approaches to the presentation of news through the BBC’s website.

For hundreds of years, North Pole Inc. and its global network of elvish subsidiaries have been gathering data on what children across the world want for Christmas, who has been naughty or nice and the latest toy trends.

To meet children’s needs, North Pole Inc. relies on up-to-date information spanning delivery routes (by air, boat and donkey), building entrances and exits, fireplace hazards, stocking sizes, reindeer health, movement and feed. The problem is, the global population is expanding and companies like North Pole Inc. everywhere are being forced to find new, more efficient ways of delivering services.

This year, a crack team at North Pole Inc. has been working on developing and implementing the data infrastructure that Christmas needs, to keep children happy for years to come.

Friday lunchtime lecture: Improving UK government spending using data science,ODI Fridays,"open data,ODIFridays,open data institute,government,spending,William Jones,lunchtime,lectures,Government Spending In The United Kingdom",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIPfyRg7fHI,"In February 2015 the UK government launched Contracts Finder, a portal that advertises open government-spending contract opportunities, allowing companies to easily and quickly bid for them. The UK spends £250 billion every year on public spending contracts, including vital public services like the NHS and it’s important that this money is spent as efficiently as possible.

As part of an ASI fellowship, William Jones worked in collaboration with the UK Cabinet Office to increase the number of companies bidding on these contracts. He did this by automatically recommending them contracts which are available and relevant, using publicly accessible information from UK companies. The web application William built is called Contracts Recommender. His talk will explain the public sources of information he uses as well as how Contracts Recommender works.

William Jones was recently awarded the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the Cambridge Computer Laboratory with Distinction. During the ASI fellowship he first worked on a deep learning image classification project with Tractable.io, using the convolutional neural network framework Caffe. Following this he joined a project with the Cabinet Office using natural language processing to automatically recommend relevant government procurement contracts to companies in the UK. He has just started a PhD in Mathematical Genomics at Cambridge.

Friday lunchtime lecture: Unfamiliar topologies,ODI Fridays,"open data,Open Data Institute,topologies,Wesley Goatley,Georgina Voss",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9PMlCQ83qk,"Are physical and data infrastructures distinct? In this talk, Georgina Voss and Wesley Goatley will present and discuss their infrastructure data artwork “Familiars”, which directly intercepted logistical radio signals broadcast by planes, ships, and trains, highlighting the material aspects of data infrastructures. In unpacking the research and development behind “Familiars”, they’ll explore how access to forms of “open” data is mediated and who this data is really intended for. While the UK government is currently investing in the “best” ways to plan, create, and fund vital infrastructure projects, they’ll argue that engaging with crucial questions around control, ownership and access to data requires an understanding of their physical components and context.

Wesley Goatley is an artist and researcher.

Georgina Voss is a technology anthropologist, writer, and co-founder of research co-operative “Strange Telemetry”.

Matt Burgess examines how FOI and open data can be combined to enhance the UK’s openness. Drawing on real-world examples, he will suggest how those promoting transparency can identify ways of encouraging more important information to be published.

Matt Burgess is a journalist and author, who has a special interest in the Freedom of Information Act. He has written the book, Freedom of Information: A Practical Guide for Journalists, and runs the FOI Directory website.

The ODI is exploring how we can create, share, collaborate and use information to create better cities. We believe that the key to making a city smart is putting people and openness at the heart of its design and operation. Together, people create the cultures that shape a city’s identity, its rhythm, its sense of community, its diversity, and ultimately ensures the collective well-being of its citizens.
