There are <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/search?keyword=open+data"> over 600 open data services</a> listed in GOV.UK's <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/">Digital Marketplace</a>. Services range from platform and software services for publishing open data to geospatial and visualisation tools, and as well as consultancy and training. Where to begin?

In early 2014 <a href="https://github.com/theodi/odi-gcloud-analysis">the ODI reviewed</a> Digital Marketplace suppliers mentioning the terms 'open data' and 'opendata' to identify if they had a strong open data proposition. This produced the list of services and suppliers below. 

Whilst there are now more providers in what is a fast developing area this makes for a good starting point. Another place to begin when considering procuring an open data service, or work that requires an understanding of open data, is the <a href="https://directory.theodi.org/members"> ODI's member directory</a>, many of whom are listed UK government suppliers.

Deloitte will help departments to deliver this by capturing a clear understanding of their data's current availability and the actions needed to increase that availability. This may be used to assist portfolio planning or support business case development. The White Paper stated a principle that organisations should “Release data quickly, and then work to make sure that it is available in open standard formats, including linked-data forms.” The industry standard for measuring data availability is the 'Five Stars of Linked Open Data', specified by Sir Tim Berbers-Lee. The pinnacle of availability is considered to be a 5 star 'linked data' rating which indicates that the data is both available and is already linked to other data sources; allowing it to be easily exploited to generate insight. It may not be practical or good value for money to attempt to make all of an organisation's data meet this standard. To make meaningful progress, each department will need to understand where their gaps are, the ones to focus on that will drive the greatest value and the practical steps they can take to resolve these gaps. Deloitte will guide the client through this process, using a standardised approach, drawing on our extensive experience of data quality, data management and data transformation. We will also bring industry leading experts to this process from our excellent contacts in academia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Where departments have identified candidate data Deloitte will design and deliver the change required. This may include delivery of infrastructure, tools, format transformation and data transformation. This change will be driven by the experience of our industry-leading experts in this field. The White Paper stated a principle that organisations should “Release data quickly, and then work to make sure that it is available in open standard formats, including linked-data forms.” The industry standard for measuring data availability is the 'Five Stars of Linked Open Data', specified by Sir Tim Berbers-Lee. The pinnacle of availability is consider to be a 5 star 'linked data' rating which indicates that the data is both available and is already linked to other data sources; allowing it to be easily exploited to generate insight. Whether it is the client's intention to transform to this level of maturity, or simply to make the data available on the web in its current form, Deloitte can scope, design and deliver the change needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Its approach is hands-on, developing real solutions, ranging from open source software tools to training materials to connecting communities through working groups, to strategy consultancy for data publishers. The OKF has deployed or enabled others to deploy a large set of more than 50 digital data repositories around the world (ckan.org/instances). They run on software developed by the OKF, and range from every level of government to NGOs and community-driven portals.

It can be used as a cost-effective and efficient way of giving a whole organisation access to high quality map data, without the need for large local copies of the datasets to maintain in-house. With Getmapping WMS Collections, an organisation can remove the need to store and maintain their own copies of base mapping which saves time and frees IT resources and costs. Getmapping ensures all base maps are up-to-date which means each user can rely on the service to display the latest maps. It also ensures continuity over an organisation as each user is viewing the same version of the map. Getmapping WMS Collections: OS OpenData provides access to all the Ordnance Survey raster base maps available as OS OpenData. They are as follows; OS MiniScale, OS 1:250,000 Scale Colour Raster, OS VectorMap District and OS StreetView. Getmapping also value-adds the datasets to provide faded and greyscale versions of the mapping. The OS OpenData WMS Collection is a popular streaming product for large and small organisations as it provides a range of useful map scales that can underpin critical business operations at a very low annual cost. Getmapping WMS Collections can be connected to any OGC-compliant software package, or any WMS-compatible API. It can also be used directly within a web browser. Popular compatible software includes Pitney Bowes MapInfo Professional, ESRI ArcGIS, Quantum GIS, CadCorp SIS, Gaia and Getmapping GIS, among others. All Getmapping WMS Collections offer a 99.9% or greater service uptime and typical map load speeds range from less than 1 second on a Broadband connection up to 5 seconds on a mobile internet connection. These may vary depending on an organisation’s connection. Getmapping are very happy to provide demo accounts so the service can be tested on a customer’s own connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It is used by various national governments and public institutions around the world, like data.gov.uk, data.gov, and the EU open data portal (see also www.ckan.org/instances). WHY CKAN? Some core characteristics make it a perfect choice for any public sector institution: CKAN.org is a community-based open source project and the source code is AGPL v3 licensed. This open approach assures users maximum room for manoeuvre in the future, protects their investment and prevents vendor lock-in. CKAN’s architecture is highly modular: components and extensions allow the system to be customized to your needs. Developers can easily extend its functionality without the need to understand the whole system. In addition, CKAN offers a rich RESTful API (using JSON representations) that exposes all of CKAN’s core functionality to external client applications using only open web standards. Finally, CKAN adheres to open standards ensuring interoperability like INSPIRE, OGC CSW, metadata based on DCAT, as well as HTML and web services based on REST. FEATURES. CKAN supports publishers and data re-users alike. Publishers benefit from easy metadata management, workflow and approval support, user authorization, the reporting of broken links, and analytics and use stats. Re-users benefit from a long list of search and discovery features, like powerful search/filtering incl. “following” datasets, faceted browsing by tags/publishers/keywords/etc., a data explorer that allows preview, inspection and basic graphing for many types of data. In addition, CKAN offers INSPIRE-compliant geospatial capabilities like geo-search, map visualization, and metadata schemas (ISO19139, Gemini2.1, CSW); harvesting and normalization of metadata from other catalogs/servers from a variety of servers (CKAN, ArcGIS, Geoportal, Z39.50, WAF, CSW); data catalog interoperability (Data Catalog Interoperability Protocol) allowing search across different catalogs; multilingual support. SERVICE. The deployment package is geared towards cities (or federal agencies) who want to set up their own open data portal. It includes Deployment, Testing, Template/Theme Design, and Template/Theme Development of the latest stable release of CKAN 2.x. Usually, portals are deployed on client’s servers, but we can offer alternatives if you prefer a different setup. Maintenance and support as well as bespoke extension, e.g., dashboards or visualisations, are available separately. Please see “CKAN open source open data portal - maintenance/support and technical consulting on demand” on G-Cloud. All core maintainers of CKAN are working for the Open Knowledge Foundation. Thus we can provide the complete technical know-how about CKAN in-house.

Its approach is hands-on, developing real solutions, ranging from open source software tools to training materials to connecting communities through working groups, to strategy consultancy for data publishers. We offer three different Open Data training courses. They are designed to help organisations during the various stages of implementing Open Data programs and portals. Our one-day introduction course is for organisations interested in getting the basics about open data. Our two five-day intensive courses for open data professionals are for organisations engaging seriously with open data: The administrative course covers all aspects from designing, planning and running an open data program, and the technical course covers everything from deploying a state-of-the-art open data portal to enhancing its functionality. Customized training courses tailored to your specific needs can be developed and delivered on demand. Please refer to the service definition and the pricing document for more details on the three courses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
